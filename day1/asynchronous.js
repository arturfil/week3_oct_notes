 - Javascript is synchronous but has asynchronous behavior
 - This means it runs in order or in a timeline.
 - BUT it can delegate processes, leave them running in the background,
 and continue with other tasks at hand.
 - Single threaded. (Only yourself making coffee)
 - Multi threaded. (3 people handling all tasks);
